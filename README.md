# ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe (Python + Tkinter)

A **desktop Tic Tac Toe game** built with **Python** and **Tkinter**. It offers both **two-player** and **AI modes**, with the AI powered by the **Minimax algorithm** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning** for optimal moves.

## 🎮 Features

- **Two Modes**:
  - 👥 **Two-Player Mode** → Play locally with a friend.  
  - 🤖 **AI Mode** → Challenge the computer using Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning.  

- **Game Mechanics**:
  - Real-time board updates.  
  - Detects wins, losses, and draws automatically.  
  - Simple and user-friendly interface.  
  - 🔄 **Restart Button** to quickly start a new game.  

- **AI Intelligence**:
  - Uses **Minimax Algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** for efficient and optimal decision-making.  
  - Ensures the AI never loses (at best, it draws).
